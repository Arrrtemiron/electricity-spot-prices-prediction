# electricity-spot-prices-prediction

This is my code for Diploma at HSE on topic "electricity spot prices prediction using stochastic volatility models"

Repo contains following:
- EDA. Some basic visualisations of used data
- datasets. Used data for Russian market of electricity
- fit_predict_notebooks. Contains notebooks with fitting models on train set and predicting values from test set. Also there is a sample of notebook to fit parameters (not best run tbh)
- stan_models_code. Code for stan models used during work
